# File-Read-Malloc-Arrays-In-Functions-and-More
Program with multiple functions. File read, malloc, converting signed decimals to hex and 2's complement and functions with array as arguments.

Program reads a file where the 1st value is the size of the total numbers to be converted. The rest of the values read are converted from signed decimal values
to hex, and to 2's complement binary number.

The program also has an array of pointers(array of strings) which it prints in a specific format.

Lastly, the program simulates a dice rolling game.
Each person rolls a pair of dice, the players with the lowest difference of the roll of their dice wins. Program displays if there are multiple winners(tie)
